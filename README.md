# Obsidian Execute Code Plugin

This plugin allows you to execute code snippets in code blocks in your notes. The plugin adds a 'run' button for code
blocks in supported languages. Clicking them results in the code of the block being executed. After the execution the
result of the execution is showed.

The result is shown only after the execution is finished. It is not possible to enter text on the command line into the
executed program now.

The following [languages are supported](#supported-programming-languages): CPP, Golang, Groovy, Kotlin, Java,
JavaScript, TypeScript, Lua, CSharp, Prolog, Rust, Python, R, Shell & Powershell.

Python and Rust support embedded plots. All languages support ["magic" commands](#magic-commands) that help you to
access paths in obsidian or show images in your notes.

You can create code blocks that are executed before or after each code block of the same language and
define [global code injections](#global-code-injection-and-reusing-code-blocks).

## Supported programming languages

- JavaScript
	- Requirements: Node.js is installed and the correct path is set in the settings.
    ```javascript
    function hello(name){
        console.log(`Hello ${name}!`);
    }
	
    hello("Bob")
    ```

- TypeScript
	- Requirements: Node.js installed then npm install typescript and ts-node.
    ```ts
    let message: string = 'Hello, World!';  
    console.log(message);
	```

- Lua
	- Requirements: install lua and config lua path
    ```lua
    print('Hello, World!')
	```

- CSharp
	- Requirements: install dotnet core sdk and `dotnet tool install -g dotnet-script`, then config dotnet-script fullpath.

    sns.set_style("darkgrid")
    iris = sns.load_dataset('iris')
    sns.FacetGrid(iris, hue ="species",
        height = 5).map(plt.scatter,
        'sepal_length',
        'petal_length').add_legend()

    plt.show()
	```

- Squiggle: For Squiggle support look at the [Obsidian Squiggle plugin](https://github.com/jqhoogland/obsidian-squiggle)
  by @jqhoogland.

Support for the following is planned:

- Matlab
- Julia Lang

Open for suggestions.

## Magic Commands

Magic commands are some meta commands that can be used in the code block. They are processed by the plugin before the
source code is executed.

The following magic commands are supported:

- `@vault`: Inserts the vault path as string.
- `@note`: Inserts the note path as string.
- `@title`: Inserts the note title as string.
- `@show(ImagePath)`: Displays an image at the given path in the note.
- `@show(ImagePath, Width, Height)`: Displays an image at the given path in the note.
- `@show(ImagePath, Width, Height, Alignment[center|left|right])`: Displays an image at the given path in the
  note.

(`@show(...)` is only supported for JavaScript and Python yet.)

![Example how to use the magic commands.](https://github.com/twibiral/obsidian-execute-code/blob/master/images/magic_example.png?raw=true)

## Running in Preview

Adding `run-` before the language name in the code blocks (as in the example below) renders the code block in the
preview already.
This allows you to execute the code in the preview.

```
```run-python
def hello(name):
print("Hello", name)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        hello("Eve")
`````` 

## Global Code Injection and Reusing Code Blocks

Sometimes it is helpful to have code that is executed before or after each other block of the same language. This plugin
supports this in two ways:

### Global Injection in the Settings

All languages have a 'global inject' option in the settings that allows defining code to be added to the top of
every single code block on a per-language basis. Code reuse fully works with all languages, and all existing magic
commands, including showing images, and inline plot outputs. This can be used to define e.g. often used functions or
import your favourite packages or libraries.

### Note-wide Pre- and Post-Code Blocks

You can add `Pre` before the language name to create a block that is executed before each following code block:

```
```pre-python
import pandas as pd
``````

This code block is added before each python block you define below in the note and import the pandas package.

`Post` blocks work the same way but the code in post blocks is executed _after_ your other code blocks.

Pre-/Post-blocks will only apply to code blocks defined below them, and will only apply to code blocks from the same
language.

## Installation

In your vault go to Settings > Community plugins > Browse and search for "Execute Code". Select the plugin, install it
and activate it.

or

Follow [this link](https://obsidian.md/plugins?search=execute%20code#) and click "Open in Obsidian".

## Warning

Do not execute code from sources you don't know or code you don't understand. Executing code can cause irreparable
damage.

## Known Problems

- Missing when `run` button after switching the theme: Try to close and reopen your notes and wait for a few minutes. It
  seems like obsidian doesn't call the postprocessors after the theme switch.
- Pre- / Post-blocks may not be executed if the file contains duplicate code blocks.

## Future Work

- Find better way to show that the program is running (for example a loading sign).
- Notebook Mode similar to Jupyter
- Global Declarations that make method and variable definitions available to subsequent code blocks
- Key combination to execute all code blocks in a file
- Error warning when the execution fails (e.g. when python isn't installed)
- Test if this plugin works in combination with dataview.
